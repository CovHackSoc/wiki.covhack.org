# Welcome to CovHack 2019!

Welcome to CovHack! We hope you build some great projects this weekend! Here is all you (probably) need to know!

If something isn't listed here, feel free to ask us in the `#questions` channel on Discord!

## Getting Here

Please have a PDF of your ticket handy so we can sign people in quickly!

You can find directions on google maps here: https://goo.gl/maps/dQpKZDhbsx12

Our venue is open overnight. You can sleep here.

## First Hackathon?

### What to Bring?

* A laptop (or your gaming rig) and it's power supply
* Toiletries
* Hardware (BRING YOUR DANCEMAT!)

### What to expect?

Hacks normally run like so:

* Opening ceremony with logistics information, etc
* Team building (if you want a team and don't already have one)
* 24 hours of building a unique and wacky project
* Demoing it to everyone
* Prizes!

### What do I build?

Hackathons are a great place to learn new technology, so we highly recommend you pick up a new language or tool you aren't
familiar with!

Hardware projects are awesome and you will always get mad props for doing one!

Regarding how much you should be able to get done:

* As a rule of thumb, you aren't going to get anything more done that what you'd be able to do in two normal work days.
* Beowulf has found they manage to write ~300 lines of code for most of their hackathon projects (more for web dev, less
for more technical projects). You'll be throwing away a lot of code so nice to keep this in mind.

## Submissions

### Devpost

We're using Devpost to manage project submissions, which is available here:

<a href="https://covhack19.devpost.com/">https://covhack19.devpost.com/</a>

Please do not start projects before 12:00 on the Saturday! You can have ideas beforehand, but don't write any code!

### Judging

We're looking at projects that impress our technically, how polished they are and how much the team learned building it.

### Prizes

#### First / Second / Third

#### "Jeoffrey" Prize for Hacker Spirit

Build a robot out of Pizza boxes at 4am because your previous plan fell apart? Then this prize is for you!

#### Beginners Prize

Best project made by teams with over 50% first time hackers!
