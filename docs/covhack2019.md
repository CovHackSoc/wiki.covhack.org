# Welcome to CovHack 2019!

Welcome to CovHack! We hope you build some great projects this weekend! Here is all you (probably) need to know!

If something isn't listed here, feel free to ask us in the `#questions` channel on Discord!

## First Hackathon?

### What to Bring?

* A laptop (or your gaming rig) and it's power supply
* Toiletries
* Hardware (BRING YOUR DANCEMAT!)

### What to expect?

Hacks normally run like so:

* Opening ceremony with logistics information, etc
* Team building if you want a team and don't already have one
* 24 Hours of building a unique and wacky project
* Demoing it to everyone
* Prizes!

### What do I build?

Hackathons are a great place to learn new technology! So we highly recomend picking up a new language or tool you aren't
familar with!

Hardware projects are awesome and you will always get mad props for doing one!

We keep an ideas list at <a href="https://ideas.covhack.org/">https://ideas.covhack.org/</a>

Regarding how much you should be able to get done:

* As a rule of thumb, you aren't going to get anything more done that what you'd be able to do in two normal work days.
* Beowulf has found they manage to write ~300 lines of code for most of their hackathon projects (more for web dev, less
for more technical projects). You'll be throwing away a lot of code so nice to keep this in mind.

## Submissions

### Devpost

We're using Devpost to manage project submissions, which is available here:

<a href="https://covhack19.devpost.com/">https://covhack19.devpost.com/</a>

Please do not start projects before 12:00 on the Saturday! You can have ideas beforehand, but don't write any code!

### Judging

### Prizes

#### First / Second / Third

#### "Jeoffrey" Prize for Hacker Spirit

Build a robot out of Pizza boxes at 4am because your previous plan fell apart? Then this prize is for you!
