# First Hackathon?

## Things to Bring

### Important
* Something to write Code on (Laptop, Desktop, Tablet, etc)
* DO NOT FORGET CHARGERS.
* Extention cords come in very handy.
* Headphones
* Hygine products
* Stuff to sleep in.
* Open Mind :)

### Optional
* Ideas (Maybe join another team or look at sponsor prizes to determine what you do)
* Hardware to work with (Some have hardware labs, but you want to do something cool, bring your own)
* Snacks (They'll be provided but if you prefer something you should bring your own. A sandwich might be good if you are picky)
* Stickers (Form a sticker pile!)
* Ear Plugs (If you plan on sleeping)
* Water Bottle (Probably can pick up at the event)
