## Projects

Some things going on that might be off interest:

### Susan Inc Haylie TSR Vel Vickery

`Susan Inc Haylie TSR Vel Vickery`, or IdeaBot, is our discord bot for 
implementing every stupid idea we have.

Started off as bot just to track project ideas, it's now expanded into having
cat memes, advice, or whatever Bear decides at 4am.
